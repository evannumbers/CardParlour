# CardParlour
A platform for playing digital card games together in the living room, lounge, parlor, or saloon

##Description
CardParlour currently offers Cards Against Humanity hosted on a Node.js server where clients connect either as players or displays.  The display shows the cards on the table, connected players, and scores.  The player sees his own hand (designed to be used from a phone).  Interactions between clients and servers are handled with Socket.io.

##Recent Changes
* All possible ways in which a person disconnects are accounted for and dealt with properly
* Card czar is now bolded in the players list

##Future Goals
* Extensive testing to find more bugs
* Easier ways to import cards
* Slicker, cleaner style on the display
* Clean up garbage code
* Fill-in-the-blank white cards
* Black cards with multiple blanks
* Starting server with single interactive command
* More games (?)
